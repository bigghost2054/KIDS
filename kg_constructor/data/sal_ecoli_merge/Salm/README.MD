This folder contains the data of list of Genes confering resistance to antibiotics from literature. 
We dont have the high throughput studies containing larg datasets like that of E.Coli. 
Some of the articles will just have one triple. Some have more. (We might not be able to use the beleif source and belief frequency on this data) 
If we are using the beleif scoring, then we might need to find a way for it.
